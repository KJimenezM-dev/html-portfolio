  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm an active-duty U.S. Army Soldier currently serving as a 25S (Satellite Communications Systems Operator-Maintainer) with a strong passion for technology and problem-solving. My background in the military has shaped my discipline, leadership, and adaptability — traits I now apply as I transition into a career in cybersecurity and software engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently studying Computer Science and actively building skills in full-stack development, ethical hacking, and cloud infrastructure. My goal is to become a cybersecurity professional, with a focus on penetration testing and infrastructure security. I enjoy building projects that challenge me and expand my knowledge, whether it's automating systems, analyzing vulnerabilities, or creating secure, scalable applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of tech, I’m passionate about fitness, competitive challenges, and constantly pushing my limits — whether in the gym, in code, or in leadership. I believe in continuous improvement and lifelong learning.
